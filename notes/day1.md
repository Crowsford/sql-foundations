I don't understand what this will lead to yet, but I want to learn SQL and Postgres. We have created a database and tables in it. Later, we will create order\_items and payments and fill in the tables with data for practice. I

thought we'd need some puzzles first. I added some data so that I could train. As well as tasks and ways to solve them.

Installed PostgreSQL 18, port 5433 (Windows service OK)



Connected via DBeaver



Created DB de\_learning, schemas raw and core



Created core tables: users/products/orders



Added seed data (10 users, 10 products, 15 orders)



Solved Day 1: 10 basic SQL queries (filters, sorting, aggregates, HAVING)
